            As a Production Engineer Fellow at Major League Hacking since June 2023, I have had the
            opportunity to engage in fruitful collaboration with my peers through regular stand-ups and daily one-on-one
            meetings.
        </p>
        <p>During this time, I have been fortunate to receive mentorship from experienced Meta production
            engineers, who have imparted invaluable knowledge on various subjects such as continuous integration and
            delivery, containerization, and networking.</p>
        <p>These interactions have not only enhanced my technical skills but
            also provided me with a solid foundation for navigating the intricacies of production engineering.</p>

            As a Supplemental
            Instructor since August 2023, I have been responsible for facilitating
            interactive and collaborative sessions aimed at enhancing students' comprehension of course material.
            Through
            these sessions, I have successfully contributed to a remarkable average grade increase of 10%. To achieve
            this,
            I focused on reinforcing important computer science fundamentals, including data structures, programming
            paradigms, and object-oriented programming.
        </p>
        <p>By creating an engaging and supportive learning environment, I have
            helped students grasp these fundamental concepts more effectively, resulting in improved academic
            performance.</p>

            As a Research Assistant at CSU Fullerton from May 2023 to August 2023, I had the opportunity
            to engage in diverse and impactful projects. One of my notable achievements was co-developing an interactive
            website that educates users on the correlation between foodborne illness outbreaks and coastal states.
        </p>
        <p>
            By utilizing Mapbox, I effectively visualized population density and outbreak data, providing users with an
            intuitive and informative experience.</p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I actively participated in faculty-led workshops where I
            deepened my understanding of machine learning and data science concepts. These workshops proved instrumental
            in
            expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in these areas.</p>
